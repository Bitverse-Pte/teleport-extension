          your tokens and is not an exchange or a trading platform. For the
          purpose of this Agreement, the word “transaction” refers to
          transferring and receiving tokens, which is substantially different
          from transactions on the exchanges and trading platforms.

          documents or other information otherwise, you shall cooperate with us

          the amount and times of transfers based on your location, regulatory
          requirements, transferring purposes, our risk control, or
          identification verification. You also understand that blockchain
          operations are “irrevocable” and you shall be responsible for the
          consequences of your mishandling of the transactions (including

          the transaction parties being identified as special addresses subject
          to applicable restrictions, etc. You also understand that we only
          provide a tool for your token transactions and shall be deemed to have
          fulfilled our obligations once you have completed the transaction and

          8.3. Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”). You have the right to
          demand that we erase your personal information, and we shall erase it
          without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: (i)
          this personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the
          purposes for which it was processed; (ii) you withdraw consent on
          which the processing is based, and where there is no other legal
          ground for the processing; (iii) you object to the processing and
          there are no overriding legitimate grounds; (iv) your personal
          information has been unlawfully processed; (v) your personal

          in the ability of processing your information where one of the
          following applies: (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal
          information and we are verifying it; (ii) the processing is unlawful
          and you want to restrict it instead of erasure; (iii) we no longer
          need your personal information, but you need it for establishment,
          exercise or defense of legal claims; (iv) you have objected to
          processing and we are verifying whether legitimate grounds override
          your request.

        <p className="policy-level-two">
          8.5. Right to data portability. You have the right to receive your
          personal information which you provided to us in a structured,
          commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to
          transmit those data to another company, where: (i) the processing is
          based on your consent or on a contract; and (ii) the processing is
          carried out by automated means. Where technically feasible, you can
          demand that we transmit those data directly to another company.

          8.6. Right to object. You have the right to object to the processing
          of your personal information based on our legitimate interests. We
          shall no longer process your personal information unless we

          the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Where personal
          information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the

          information for such marketing.

          consent for processing of your personal information at any time. The
